# Jobly

## Description

This is an exercise to create a creating a full stack web application called Jobly, which will be used to explore and "apply" for jobs online (no, these aren't REAL jobs).

The goal of this project is to create a API with similar functionality to LinkedIn but on a smaller scale. You'll make a queryable API for companies, add in database tables for users, companies and jobs, and add in authentication and authorization!

The design of this project is to be an API where all responses are returned in JSON format.

The main routes of this project include:

1. Companies Routes - allow full CRUD
2. Jobs Routes - allow full CRUD
3. Users Routes - allow full CRUD

All of the above sections are validated with json schema. Classes and class methods have been created for each table to allow for standard CRUD operations.
