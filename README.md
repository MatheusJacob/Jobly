# Jobly

**Goals and requirements**

-   All of your responses should be in JSON. Use Insonmia or curl to test your API.
-   Be thoughtful about function and variable names, and for you to write appropriate documentation for every function and route.
-   After each section, we expect you to write tests for the routes in that section.
-   For each resource, place all of your SQL/database logic in a class. We do not want to see ANY SQL in your routes!
