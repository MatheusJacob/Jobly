Use Insonmia or curl to test your API.  \r   - Be thoughtful about function and variable names, and for you to write appropriate documentation for every function and route.  \r   - After each section, we expect you to write tests for the routes in that section.  \r   - For each resource, place all of your SQL/database logic in a class. We do not want to see ANY SQL in your routes!",
